# Directory Organization Summary

This document describes the recent reorganization of scripts and files in the AI Arena project.

## Backend Scripts Organization

All scripts have been organized from `/backend/scripts/` into categorized subdirectories:

### `/backend/scripts/metaverse/` (21 files)
Bot deployment and synchronization scripts with the metaverse
- Bot deployment scripts (deploy, redeploy, force-redeploy)
- Sync and cleanup utilities
- World instance management
- Registration fixes

### `/backend/scripts/channels/` (6 files)
Channel and world management scripts
- Channel initialization and configuration
- World discovery and health checks
- Multi-world testing

### `/backend/scripts/testing/` (9 files)
Test scripts and development utilities
- Authentication flow testing
- API endpoint testing
- Test data generation

### `/backend/scripts/maintenance/` (2 files)
System maintenance and verification
- Pre-restart verification
- World instance verification

Each folder now has a README.md with detailed descriptions of each script.

## Metaverse Game Organization

The metaverse-game directory has been cleaned up:

### `/metaverse-game/scripts/init/`
Initialization scripts for world setup

### `/metaverse-game/scripts/testing/`
Test utilities and scripts
- Moved all `.cjs` test files
- Moved test HTML files
- Organized test utilities

### Documentation
- Moved `TESTING_INVENTORY.md` to `/docs/` folder
- Added README files to script directories

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Clearer Purpose**: Scripts are grouped by functionality
2. **Easier Navigation**: Related scripts are in the same folder
3. **Better Documentation**: Each folder has its own README
4. **Cleaner Root**: Test files moved out of project roots
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and update related scripts

## Quick Access Paths

```bash
# Backend scripts
cd backend/scripts/metaverse/    # Bot deployment scripts
cd backend/scripts/channels/     # Channel management
cd backend/scripts/testing/      # Test utilities
cd backend/scripts/maintenance/  # System checks

# Metaverse scripts
cd metaverse-game/scripts/init/     # Initialization
cd metaverse-game/scripts/testing/  # Test scripts
```

## Most Used Scripts

```

### System Health Checks
```bash
