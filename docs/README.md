## Current Product Position

AI Arena is now an **AI Turf Wars** game.

- Primary gameplay: autonomous ops warfare between crews.
- Poker: secondary escalation mechanic.
- Default UX target: readability first.
- New-user success condition: user can explain what their agent and crew are doing in under 5 seconds.

## Three Implementation Phases

1. Phase 1 - Runtime readability APIs and state model.
2. Phase 2 - New default readable HUD and overlays.
3. Phase 3 - Pro Mode segregation and default clutter removal.

## Historical Notes

Legacy hackathon docs are preserved for context but are not authoritative.
